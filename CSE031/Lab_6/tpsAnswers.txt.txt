TPS 1
1. The text segment has a first address of 0x00400000 and the data segment has a first address of 0x10010000
2. Some of the commands like subi do not appear in basic and the ones there do not show anything like functions or loops.
3. There is a 4 byte difference between an address and the next one
4. There are 8 different columns for each address
5. Every column seems to represent 4 bits
6. To create a new variable named m you need to add it to .data and use .word to read the integer, followed by the value 20 to set it to 20
8. To initialize a srting, we do somewhat the same process as with m but we use .acsiiz followed by "" with our string inside it
9. It is addressed at 0x10010008 - 0x10010013
10. The way they are saved is character by character in hex value and seems to go backwards, it is different from what I expected in lab 4.
12. la $t3, n loads the adress at t3 with the variable we had created before which is n
