TPS 1
4. This line stores the value of the sum of n and m so we can print later.
5. We could use j if the label is correct
6. The return value is stated in line 14 and is stores in $a0, this holds m + n which makes sense because $a0 is the value printed.
7. The code has an error when trying to run it as it is
8. The address keeps needing to be $a0 due to the syscall to printo the result
10. The output of the program is 15
11. We should use jal.
