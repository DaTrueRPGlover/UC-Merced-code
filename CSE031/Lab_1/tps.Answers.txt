TPS 2
1. To open the terminal in my computer, I can search for it with the search bar or I can pin it to the task bar and use it that way. To open more than one terminal I have to right click my terminal program and open a new one. Sometimes when working with terminals, there can be some quick changes you can do with two or more terminals open.
2. To be able to know what the directory contains, you need to use the command "ls".
3. To go to my desktop folder I have to first do a cd ~ and then a cd C:\Users\ferna\OneDrive\Escritorio
4. To create a folder I need to use the command "mkdir" followed by the name I want to give to that folder

add each digit and use modulo to know if it is even or odd

if a number's digits are even, add them up and divide by the quantity of numbers that are even
