1. The line that creates the seg fault is line 22
2. To fix it, we need to add an "&" when using scanf for input.
3. The value of sum is a double and that does not work 
4. We change the value taken to be a double pointer

1. The output does not act as expected, there are extra letters and symbols appended
2. The input is saved somewhere that should not be and it prints it when it is not asked to
3. The output is not expected, the letters start to bleed and the idea is that the char arrays are declared too close to each other.
